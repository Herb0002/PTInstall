PTFeeder is an add-on for the ProfitTrailer trading bot that provides dynamic settings based on market conditions. PTManager is a web interface that allows you to manage your ProfitTrailer and PTFeeder instances.

Requirements

ProfitTrailer licenses.

Guide to Install PT Manager on Linux
Open the terminal on your Linux system.

Create a new user named profittrailer:
sudo adduser profittrailer

Grant profittrailer user sudo permissions:
sudo usermod -aG sudo profittrailer

Switch to the profittrailer user:
su - profittrailer

Note: You can also run the installation as the root user, but this is not recommended for security reasons.

Switch to the profittrailer user's home directory:
cd /home/profittrailer

Download the latest version of the installation scripts from GitHub, wie the git clone command:
git clone https://github.com/Herb0002/PTInstall.git

Note: The git clone command requires that git is installed on your system. If git is not installed, you can install it with the following command:
sudo apt-get install git

Navigate to the downloaded directory with the cd command: cd /home/profittrailer/PTInstall

Make the main installation script (Index.sh) executable:
chmod +x Index.sh

Run the installation/update script:
./Index.sh

Wait for the installation to complete. At the end of the script execution, you will receive a random key and a link to log in to PT Manager.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed PT Manager on your Linux system.
